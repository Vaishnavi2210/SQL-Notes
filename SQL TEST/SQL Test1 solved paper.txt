******************** SQL Test  **************************

-------- SECTION A ----------

Q1. Difference between DDL, DML, DCL commands with example.

=> In SQL, DDL, DML, and DCL are commands used to manage, database Operations with their objects.
    * DDL - DDL is (DATA Defination language) it used to define and modify the structure of database objects.
          - its used to CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE and RENAME data
          - it is used to define structure. we cannot rollback it.
              
         EX. CREATE TABLE Student(
                 id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                 name VARCHAR(50) NOL NULL
                );
        
             
             DROP TABLE  Student;

      DML - DML is (Data Manipulation language) used to manage and manipulate data.
          - we can perform CRUD operation using DML commands.
          - it Used to INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and Retrive(SELECT) data from table.
          - we can rollback it.  
          

          EX. INSERT INTO student(id, name)
                   VALUES
                      (1, 'Vaishnavi'),
                      (2, 'Gayatri');
              SELECT * FROM students;

      DCL - DCL ( Data control language) used to control data.
             - GRANT - used to GRANT the changes(saves)
             - REVOKE - used to remove GRANT (unsave).

Q.2 Create table students

=>      CREATE TABLE students( 
             id INT PRIMARY KEY,
             name VARCHAR(50),
             age INT,
             city VARCHAR(30),
             );

    SQL Query -
                 1) insert 3 records
                   
                     INSERT INTO students(id, name, age, city)
                           VALUES
                             (1, 'ABC', 25, 'Pune'),
                             (2, 'DEF', 26, 'Nagpur'),
                             (3, 'XYZ', 24, 'Mumbai');

                 2) SELECT * FROM students;


---------------- SECTION B --------------------------------------------

Q.1  employees(id, name, department, salary)
  
=>     a) SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 40000;

       b) SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';

       c) SELECT * FROM employees ORDER By salary DESC;

Q.2 Difference Between HAVING and WHERE

=>   a)  WHERE - is clause used to applied rules on table column. we used WHERE for retrieve, delete, and update records using condition.
           -  WHERE is not used with Aggregate functions.
          
           EX. SELECT * FROM employees
                   WHERE city = 'Nagpur';
 
     b)  HAVING - is also clause used with GROUP BY always and perform aggregate functions.
            - used with aggregate function (SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX(), COUNT())

          EX. SELECT department_id, MAX(salary)
              FROM employees
              GROUP BY department_id
              HAVING salary MAX(salary) > 100000;


Q.3 Write Query

=>   a) SELECT * FROM employees 
             WHERE name LIKE 'A%';

     b) SELECT * FROM employees
             WHERE salary BETWEEN(30000 AND 70000);


Q.4


--------------- SECTION C --------------------------------

Q.1  Explain INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN
         
       students(id, name, course_id);
       courses(course_id, course_name);
      
=>   a) INNER JOIN - INNER JOIN is used to retrieve matching records from both table.
          
          SELECT s.id, c.course_id
             FROM 
                students s
             INNER JOIN
                courses c
             ON s.course_id = c.course_id
             GROUP BY s.id, c.course_id;


     b) LEFT JOIN - LEFT JOIN is used to retrieve all records from left table and matching records from right table.

           
       SELECT  s.id, s.name, c.course_id
             FROM 
                students s
             LEFT JOIN
                courses c
             ON s.course_id = c.course_id;
             GROUP BY s.id, s.name, c.course_id;


      
Q.3  SELECT  s.id, s.name, c.course_id, c.course_name
        FROM
           students s
        INNER JOIN
           courses c
        ON s.course_id = c.course_id
        GROUP BY s.id, s.name, c.course_id, c.course_name;



---------------------------- SECTION D ------------------------------


Q.2  Write Query
=>
        CREATE TABLE orders(
            order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
            customer_name VARCHAR(50),
            order_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
            amount DECIMAL (0, 0) 
         );
          

        a) INSERT INTO orders(order_id, customer_name, order_date, amount)
                 VALUES
                   (1, 'Jaydeep', '1-11-2025', 12000 ),
                   (2, 'Kartik', '1-11-2025', 15000 );
                   


       b) SELECT * FROM orders
                 WHERE  order_date BETWEEN ('1-11-2025' AND '30-11-2025');
